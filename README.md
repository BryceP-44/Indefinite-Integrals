# Indefinite-Integrals
Still in development. 
User inputs an expression that must have a proper form that would appear in an integral table. I will add in constants and change the substitution lists to be more efficient. It works for 20 common integral forms, but it will soon have a better output and solving steps. There are still bugs on some of them which are easy to fix, just not enough time right now. Depending on your computer, you should get about 15 thousand iterations per second, and gets maxed out at about 450 thousand total combinations.
